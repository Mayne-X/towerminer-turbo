//! # towerminer — TowerWalk CPU miner for Jetsam (JTM)
//!
//! Speaks exactly the protocol of `jetsam-extminer` (getBlockTemplate /
//! submitBlock, Bearer key, pool `nonce_prefix` in bits 96..128, a per-process
//! offset in bits 64..96, one second of submit margin), so it runs against a
//! Jetsam node in `--mode extminer` or a compatible pool unchanged. What
//! differs is the engine:
//!
//! - persistent pinned worker threads, each owning its pads in huge pages and
//!   grinding the current job without a per-template rayon pass;
//! - several nonces walked in lockstep per thread (see `walk.rs`);
//! - a profile chosen from the CPU family, the L2 size and the SMT layout the
//!   kernel reports, not a model name;
//! - every solution re-verified by the reference walk before it is submitted,
//!   a sentinel hash re-checked every 4096, a golden self-test at start-up.
//!
//! The thermal-guard build (`--features fleet`, Linux) adds a thermal guard on
//! its own thread (`guard.rs`); the default build has none.
